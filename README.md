# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Repository

This comprehensive repository covers a wide range of NLP techniques and applications. It provides an extensive collection of functionalities that can be utilized to process and analyze text data effectively. The repository includes the following topics:

- ## Sentiment Analysis, Analogies, and Word Translation

Utilize `Logistic Regression`, `NaÃ¯ve Bayes`, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis. These models enable you to classify the sentiment of text data, making it easier to understand the emotions expressed in various texts. 

Additionally, leverage word vectors to complete analogies and perform word translation tasks. Explore the relationships between words and utilize locality-sensitive hashing to approximate nearest neighbors for efficient processing.

- ## Dynamic Programming, Hidden Markov Models, and Word Embeddings

Implement dynamic programming techniques to autocorrect misspelled words and autocomplete partial sentences. Utilize `Hidden Markov models` (HMMs) to identify part-of-speech tags for words, enhancing the understanding of the grammatical structure of sentences. 

Additionally, leverage word embeddings to improve the accuracy of autocorrection and autocompletion tasks.

- ## Advanced NLP with Neural Networks

Leverage dense and `Recurrent Neural Networks` (RNNs), including `LSTMs`, `GRUs`, and Siamese networks, using `TensorFlow` and `Trax` frameworks. 

These advanced models enable you to perform tasks such as advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and identification of duplicate questions. Explore the capabilities of these models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various NLP tasks.

- ## Encoder-Decoder, Causal, and Self-Attention Models

Implement `Encoder-Decoder` architectures, causal models, and `Self-Attention mechanisms` to perform advanced machine translation of complete sentences. These models excel at tasks such as text summarization, question-answering, and building chatbots. Gain expertise in transformer-based models like T5, BERT, transformer, reformer, and more using the ðŸ¤— Transformers library.
