## Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces

This project focuses on various NLP techniques, including sentiment analysis, vector space models, and translation algorithms. The repository offers the following functionalities:

* **Sentiment Analysis:** Perform sentiment analysis on tweets using `Logistic Regression` and `Naïve Bayes classifiers`. These models enable you to classify tweets as positive/real, negative/fake, or neutral based on their sentiment. You can choose between `Logistic Regression` and `Naïve Bayes classifiers` approaches depending on your requirements and data characteristics.

* **Vector Space Models:** Utilize vector space models to discover relationships between words. By representing words as vectors, you can calculate their similarity and explore semantic relationships. Additionally, `Principal Component Analysis` (PCA) is available to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space, enabling you to visualize the relationships between words.

* **English to French Translation:** Implement a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality-sensitive hashing. This algorithm leverages approximate `k-nearest neighbor` search to relate words, facilitating the translation process between the two languages.
